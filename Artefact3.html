            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved creating a Toy Inventory Management System using Java. 
                The application allows users to manage a list of toys, including adding, removing, and purchasing toys, 
                as well as making gift suggestions based on user input.</p>

            <h2>Data Structures Used</h2>
            <p>The primary data structure used in this project is a <strong>List</strong> (specifically, an <code>ArrayList</code>) to store the inventory of toys. Each toy is represented as an object of the <code>Toy</code> class or its subclasses (<code>Figures</code>, <code>Animal</code>, <code>Puzzles</code>, and <code>BoardGames</code>). This allows for polymorphism and easy management of different toy types.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the application uses a <code>Scanner</code> object for user input and file handling classes like <code>BufferedReader</code> and <code>BufferedWriter</code> for reading from and writing to files.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the application could handle various user inputs gracefully. To overcome this, I implemented input validation throughout the code, checking for valid serial numbers, toy types, and price values. This helped prevent runtime errors and ensured a smooth user experience.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was managing the file I/O operations. I had to ensure that the data was correctly formatted in the text file and that the application could read and write data without errors. I addressed this by implementing exception handling to catch and manage potential I/O issues.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Workflow and Competence</h2>
            <p>My workflow for this project was systematic and organized. I began by outlining the requirements and functionalities of the application. I then designed the class structure, focusing on the <code>Toy</code> class and its subclasses to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of different toy types.</p>
            <p>After implementing the core functionalities, I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all features worked as intended. I also sought feedback from peers to identify any areas for improvement. The final product was a robust application that successfully managed toy inventory and provided a user-friendly interface.</p>

                    System.out.println("\nSaving Data Into Database...\n************ THANKS FOR VISITING US! ************");
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid option. Please try again.");
            }

            if (option != 5) {
                System.out.println("\nPress Enter to continue...");
                scanner.nextLine();
                scanner.nextLine();
            }
        } while (option != 5);

        scanner.close();
