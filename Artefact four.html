            <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
            <p>For this project, I worked on it witha group of other people and we were tasked
                with creating a podcast to talk about calgary culture/history; as well as
                interviewing some very important people to gain more insight into calgary culture.</p>
                <p>In doing so, we successfully created a podcast which we named Tourist tales</p>Here is a little snippet of what was recorded,
                 <strong>Tourist Tales: Your One Stop Shop for All Things Local Calgary</strong>, is
                dedicated to celebrating Calgary culture. If you're tuning in for the first time, welcome and thanks for
                joining us! Every week, we sit down to discuss a particular event or attraction that we believe deserves
                to be given a platform. Our goal is to highlight the unique aspects of Calgary and share stories that
                resonate with both locals and visitors.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>Working on this project as a group presented several challenges.
                One of the main difficulties was coordinating schedules among team members for recording sessions.
                To overcome this, we established a shared calendar to find common availability and set regular meeting
                times.
                Additionally, we faced technical challenges with audio quality during recordings.
                After some trial and error, we invested time in learning about sound editing software and best practices
                for recording,
                which significantly improved our audio quality.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="workflow">
            <h2>Workflow and Competence</h2>
            <p>Our workflow was structured and collaborative. We began by brainstorming topics to discuss,
                ensuring that we covered a diverse range of events and tourist attractions happening in Calgary.
                Each team member took turns leading discussions and conducting research on their chosen tourist
                attractions and interviewing important people as well.
                I took the initiative to create a shared document where we could outline episode scripts and share
                resources.
                This not only streamlined our preparation but also allowed us to build on each other's ideas
                effectively.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I honed my skills in audio editing and content creation.
                I learned how to use software like Audacity to edit our recordings, add music, and enhance sound
                quality.
                The experience taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and adaptability in a creative
                project.
                Overall, I felt a sense of accomplishment as we successfully launched our podcast and received positive
                feedback
                from our listeners which for this project ended up being our colleagues and professor.</p>
