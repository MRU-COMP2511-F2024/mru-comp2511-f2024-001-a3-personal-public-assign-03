            <p>This was a group project where my partner and I were tasked with creating a website from scratch about chips. 
                The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of HTML and CSS. 
                We first started the project by sketching out a layout and deciding on the content we wanted to include.
                It was a difficult but fun project to work on.</p>
            <p>Here is a link to the project we worked on together: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/page1.html">Chips Quest</a></p>

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>During the development process, I encountered several challenges, particularly with responsive design. 
                Initially, my website did not display well on mobile devices. 
                After researching CSS media queries, I was able to implement a responsive layout that improved the user experience. 
                I also learned the importance of validating my HTML and CSS to avoid errors.</p>

            <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a Google Site focused on social innovation. 
                The goal was to explore how innovative ideas can address social issues and create positive change in communities.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>During the development of the Google Site, I faced challenges in organizing the content effectively. 
                Initially, I struggled with how to present the information in a way that was engaging and easy to navigate. 
                After receiving feedback from my professor, I decided to use a more visual approach, 
                incorporating images and videos to illustrate key points. 
                This experience taught me the importance of social innovation.</p>
