            <p>This was a group project where my partner and I were tasked with creating a website from scratch about
                chips.
                The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of HTML and CSS.
                We first started the project by sketching out a layout and deciding on the content we wanted to include.
                It was a difficult but fun project to work on.</p>
            <p>Here is a link to the project we worked on together: <a href="https://chipsquest-ms.netlify.app">Chips

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>During the development process, I encountered several challenges, particularly with responsive design.
                Initially, my website did not display well on mobile devices.
                After researching CSS media queries, I was able to implement a responsive layout that improved the user
                experience.
                I also learned the importance of validating my HTML and CSS to avoid errors.</p>

            <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a Google Site focused on social innovation.
                The goal was to explore how innovative ideas can address social issues and create positive change in
                communities.
                I researched various social innovation initiatives and compiled information on successful projects that
                have made a difference.</p>

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>During the development of the Google Site, I faced challenges in organizing the content effectively.
                Initially, I struggled with how to present the information in a way that was engaging and easy to
                navigate.
                After receiving feedback from my professor, I decided to use a more visual approach,
                incorporating images and videos to illustrate key points.
                This experience taught me the importance of social innovation.</p>

            <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
            <a>Through this project, I realized my passion for social innovation and my desire to create meaningful
                change in the world.
                I plan to continue exploring this field by participating in community initiatives and collaborating with
                organizations focused on social impact.
                My goal is to develop my own social innovation project that addresses a pressing issue in my community.
